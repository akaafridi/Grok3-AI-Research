## About This Research

This repository contains my independent research paper:
### *"Grok-3 â€“ Architecture Beyond GPT-4"*

A cutting-edge exploration of how Grok-3's AI architecture can surpass GPT-4 and Gemini 1.5 â€” designed with:
- Sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE)
- Robotics-grade Integration
- FP8 Precision Optimization
- Formal Safety Verification (Lean4 + Z3)
- Deployment-First Approach for Real-World AI Systems like TeslaBot
